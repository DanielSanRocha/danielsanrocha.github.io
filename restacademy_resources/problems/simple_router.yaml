text: 'Just so you can get the hang of these exercises, there is another easy one for you. Develop a API that answers two different
json objects in two different routes! <br><br>

More precisely, the API should answer ```{"message": "That is the first route!"}``` when you access the /routeA endpoint and <br>
should answer ```{"message": "That is the second route!"}``` when you access the /routeB endpoint. Below you can find a way to validate
your api. <br>
All the others routes should send a 404 status code.'
tests:
    - route: /routeA
      method: GET
      output: "That is the first route!"
      status_code: 200
    - route: /routeB
      method: GET
      output: "That is the second route!"
      status_code: 200
    - route: /jujuba
      method: GET
      status_code: 404

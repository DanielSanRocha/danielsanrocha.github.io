text: 'This first exercise is easy peasy to help check if your environment is properly set up
and the CORS headers are Ok. Your objective is to construct a API that answers exactly the text message "Hello World!"
when their index route (the /) is accessed. <br><br>

After implementing the API in your framework/language of preference,
just run it locally (or upload it to the cloud if you are brave enough), put the domain in input box below
and press ''Test it!''. <br> By default the input box comes with the url http://localhost:5000 that should be the default
route and port for several common frameworks on debug mode.
After this, we are ready for more serious stuff.'
tests:
    - route: /
      method: GET
      output: "Hello World!"
      status_code: 200

text: 'Let''s start to make things more interesting, can you construct a API that answers the square of a integer number? <br>
More precisely, make a API that when someone access the /{number} it answers with the square of the {number}. <br><br>

For example, /6 should answers 36 and /8 should answers 64.'
tests:
    - route: /3
      method: GET
      output: "9"
      status_code: 200
    - route: /10
      method: GET
      output: "100"
      status_code: 200
    - route: /1
      method: GET
      output: "1"
      status_code: 200
    - route: /6
      method: GET
      output: "36"
      status_code: 200

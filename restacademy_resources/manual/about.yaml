text: 'Welcome to the RestAcademy a simple series of exercise to help you
learn the basics of constructing rest apis! <br>
To toggle ''on'' and ''off'' this manual just click on the green book icon on top right corner
(I strongly recommend for you to read this manual until the end before attempting the exercises).
You can review this manual anytime you want.  <br> <br>

The objective of this page is to teach the basics about how the HTTP/REST protocol works through a series of exercises.
Each exercise comes with a set automatic functional tests!!!
These tests you can use to validate your work in any frameworks, programming language or databases you used.  <br>

To use the tests, just supply the address where your API is listening and the tests will run directly from your browser with live feedback!
You can use the tests to validate your solution or help understand what you did not understand. <br> <br>

Before jumping into programming, it is important that you set up your API to answer the correct CORS header so there isn''t a security issue between your browser and your api,
you can read more about it on the next page...'

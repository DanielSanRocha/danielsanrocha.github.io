name: The pesky CORS
text: 'CORS is a acronym to Cross-origin resource sharing, in a very brief manner, for security reasons when a page request
a resource in another domain (another base url) it is blocked by default. The page that had their resources requested needs to
inform the browser which third parties pages can access their resources, to do this it needs to set a specific header and that is CORS. <br><br>


How your api probably will live in another domain (http://localhost:5000 for example) it will need to set a CORS
header in the response so the browser can allow this webpage (the webpage that is performing the tests) to access your API.
If all this was very confusing what you need to know is that you will not have CORS problem
if you set your API to set the header <br><br>
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```<br><br>
in every response. This header grants access to any website to your api.
Never do this in a production environment for obviously reasons. <br><br>


A way to easily do this if you are using flask + python is to install flask-cors with the command <br><br>
```
pip install -U flask-cors
```<br><br>

And adding this snippet just after you declare the ''app'' global variable<br><br>
```
from flask_cors import CORS;
CORS(app)
```<br><br>

Most of frameworks and languages have a easy way of setting up CORS so search around and see what you can find =).
